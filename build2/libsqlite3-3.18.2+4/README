SQLite is a C library that implements an in-process SQL database engine. A
complete database is stored in a single file on disk. The code for SQLite is
in the public domain. For more information see:

https://sqlite.org/

This package contains the original SQLite library source code overlaid with
the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
the SQLite mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to
the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of SQLite for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/sqlite/
